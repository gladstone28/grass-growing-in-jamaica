            <h2>About Bermuda Grass</h2>
            <p>Bermuda grass, scientifically known as Cynodon dactylon, is a warm-season perennial grass renowned for its durability and fine texture, making it a preferred choice for sports fields, golf courses, and residential lawns in tropical and subtropical regions. Its resilience against wear and ability to quickly recover from damage are unmatched, attributes that contribute to its widespread use in areas that receive intense sun and heat.</p>
            
            <p>One of Bermuda grass's standout features is its aggressive growth habit, which allows it to quickly cover bare spots and crowd out weeds. However, this also means it requires regular maintenance to prevent it from invading garden beds and other areas. Bermuda thrives in full sunlight and performs best in well-drained, fertile soil. While it is drought-tolerant, regular watering during dry periods can promote a lush, green appearance.</p>
            
            <p>Proper care for Bermuda grass includes frequent mowing during the growing season to maintain a height of 1 to 1.5 inches, fertilizing several times a year to encourage vigorous growth, and aerating to relieve soil compaction. Dethatching may also be necessary to remove dead material that can build up and inhibit water and nutrient penetration.</p>
            
            <p>Despite its high maintenance needs, Bermuda grass's dense, soft turf and tolerance to heat and drought make it an excellent choice for those seeking a resilient and attractive lawn or sports surface in warmer climates.</p>
