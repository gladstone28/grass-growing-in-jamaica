            <h2>About St. Augustine Grass</h2>
            <p>St. Augustine grass, known scientifically as Stenotaphrum secundatum, is a widely favored choice for lawns in warm coastal areas, thanks to its high tolerance to salt and ability to thrive in both sun and shade. Characterized by its broad, flat blades and dense growth, this grass type creates a lush, green carpet that's soft underfoot, making it an attractive option for residential landscapes and public parks alike.</p>
            
            <p>Adaptable to a variety of soil types, St. Augustine grass particularly excels in sandy soil conditions, common along coastlines. While it is drought-tolerant once established, it does require consistent moisture, especially in the hottest months, to maintain its vibrant color and density. It's also important to note that St. Augustine grass is less cold-tolerant than some other grass types, limiting its use to warmer climates.</p>
            
            <p>Maintenance of St. Augustine grass involves regular mowing to keep it at the ideal height of 2.5 to 4 inches, which helps prevent weeds and ensures a thick, healthy lawn. It benefits from fertilization in spring and summer and may need occasional pest and disease management to address issues such as chinch bugs or fungal infections.</p>
            
            <p>With proper care, St. Augustine grass provides an excellent turf solution for those in warmer, humid regions looking for a robust, low-maintenance lawn that can handle a bit of shade.</p>
